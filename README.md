Time Series is a specific domain of Data Science. There are so many applications of Data Science in which this is a very high rated application. Using Time Series we can 
deal with those data which sequentially collected with respect to time. In this type of data has a oen specific property is that next observation depends on previous observation.
this is beacuse this data is collected sequentially with respect to time and this is called Autocorrelation. So all the models in Time Series we apply those assuamtions are there

----------1- No autocorrelation

----------2- No trend,seasonality

----------3- Stationarity |------>1- mean should be constant
                         
                          |------>2- variance should be constant
                         
                          |------>3- covariance should not be fuction of k or should be particular value not variable
                          
There are some plots are there to visulaise Autocorrelation and Partial Autocorrelation

1- ACF plot

2- PACF plot


We have some models by that we can do modelling in this data and do forecasting of time series data.

1-ARMA model(Auto Regressive Moving Average Model)

2-ARIMA model(Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average Model)

3-SARIMA model(Seasonality Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average Model)

4-LSTM(Long Short Term Memory)

5-RNN(Recurral Neaural Network)

6-Bidirectional RNN
